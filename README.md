**ADVENT OF CODE: JANKY EDITION**
-
Hello this is the code for my advent of code:

**2024: Python**
<small>and a little bit of C#</small>

This contains all of 2024, (minus day 15 because I made it in unity). Also Day 6 Part 2 was in C# for efficiency (and because I was determined to see my stupid solution work)

day 14 puts 10,000 images in a folder so have fun with that I guess.

**2015: C#**

I started this year because I was bored. The first 7 days are there.
