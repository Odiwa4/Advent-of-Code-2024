**THE ADVENT OF CODE 2024: JANKY EDITION**

This contains *almost* all my code from Advent of Code 2024.
The only day that wasn't included is day 15 as I did it in unity.

Also, day 14 puts 10,000 images into a folder, and day 24 uses a semi-manual solution
using a graph generator tool called GraphViz (check the days comments for more info if you want to run it.)

I did forget to make a separate file for part 2 on some days and ended up overwriting my part 1 solution so 
think of it as a sign from the universe to go read a much better solution for that days part.

P.S. this challenge was fun, even though I went insane on day 24 trying to comprehend a very much
incomprehensible graph that I generated while trying to figure out what to look for in the first place.
