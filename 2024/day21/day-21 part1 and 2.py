'''
If anyone is reading this, which (lets be honest) they aren't.
This solution is not original, this problem was difficult, and
once you've looked up the solution in the same language well,
its hard not to just remake their code I guess,

anyway
credit goes to:
https://github.com/hyperneutrino/advent-of-code/blob/main/2024/day21p2.py
for the much smarter solution then the mess I tried before.

also I forgot to include them in day 16, but I used a similar solution by them as well
